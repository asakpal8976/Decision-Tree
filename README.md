# Decision-Tree
💡 Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree 💡
Here’s a snapshot of the classification report 📊👇:
✅ Accuracy: 0.80 
🔄 Precision: Class 0: 71 , Class 1: 0.85 
🎯 Recall: Class 0: 86 , Class 1: 0.69
📏 F1-Score: Class 0: 0.78 , Class 1: 0.76
 
The model showed great potential in detecting true positives while maintaining solid precision and recall! 💯 
Here’s what I focused on:
- 🧠 Feature Selection: Analyzing key features like cholesterol, age, blood pressure, and more.
- 🌳 Decision Tree Model: Building the model to classify patients based on key health indicators.
- 📈 Model Evaluation: Using classification metrics for performance insights.

🔧 Tools & Technologies used:
- 🐍 Python
- 🧮 Scikit-Learn
- 📊 Pandas
- 🌐 Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing data trends
